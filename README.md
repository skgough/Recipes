# Recipes

Simple webapp to use my recipes on my phone when I'm cooking. It has a nifty card view that makes it easy to go step by step in the recipe and reference ingredients quickly without having to scroll up the page like lots of recipe websites make you do.

//TODO
Make a timers feature that works even if the phone is locked. Might have to learn Service Workers to do this.
